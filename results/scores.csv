log_reg_baseline.csv,0.67825,0.68005, data cleaning. logistic regression baseline
log_reg_pca_0.csv,0.60208,0.60377, applied PCA
log_reg_pca_1.csv,0.61063,0.60409, why does PCA make it worse?
log_reg_lda_0.csv,0.7356,0.72993, applied LDA
log_reg_lda_1.csv,0.7356,0.72993, LDA is better but can only train shallow models
mlp_baseline.csv,0.73529,0.72856, got lucky on the initialization on this one. Idk what the parameter is either
mlp_baseline_2.csv,0.70327,0.69916, made net shallower and lowered iteration count to run
mlp_pca_0.csv,0.55078,0.53906,I thought that the new dimensions would help mlp. I was wrong. Maybe its overfitting to garbage data?
ensemble_1.csv,0.73623,0.72993,ensemble. Weighted average of log_reg_baseline.csv log_reg_lda_0.csv and mlp_baseline.csv
log_reg_gridsearch_optimized.csv,0.7363,0.73246,took best params from Jon's gridsearch
ensemble_2.csv,0.73171,0.73798,enembled with log reg gridsearch
lin_reg.csv,0.7354,0.72973,this shouldn’t have done this good
forest_reg.csv,0.50345,0.50331,I believed in you forests! Why did you do this to me?
